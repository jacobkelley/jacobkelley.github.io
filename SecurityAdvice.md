        <br /><br />
        Security Advice is a small Github repository that I created to attempt to help new IT Security professionals in beginning their careers.
        <br /><br />
        What I noticed that prompted me to write this repo, was that a good deal of people were showing up in forums online knowing only that they thought IT Security was cool and exciting, but not where to get started.
        <br /><br />
        In order to do my part to help out, I made this repo to point them in the right direction, using HTML to link a bunch of data to use open-source learning resources to help new people to find a path in a somewhat new field.
