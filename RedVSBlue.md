        <br /><br />
        Red Vs. Blue is a program that seeks to combine all of my Red Team and Blue Team programs into a single platform, ala POSHSec.<br /><br />
        At the very least, RedVs.Blue seeks to make pre-canned scripts that can configure WIndows X (7, 8, 10) desktop systems with a minimum level of logging that will enable incident responders to determine what actually happened during a suspected incident.<br /><br />
        As with any programs, RedVs.Blue is a long-term project to integrate various Red Team and Blue Team applications onto a single, easy-to-use platform.  In some ways, RedVs.Blue is an exercise in using PowerShell to understand .NET form functionality.
