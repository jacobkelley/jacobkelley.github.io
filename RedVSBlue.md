        <br /><br />
        Red Vs. Blue is a program that seeks to combine all of my Red Team and Blue Team programs into a single platform, ala POSHSec.<br /><br />
        At the very least, Red Vs. Blue seeks to make pre-canned scripts that can configure WIndows X (7, 8, 10) desktop systems with a <u>minimum</u> level of logging that will enable incident responders to determine what actually happened during a suspected incident.<br /><br />
        In addition to configuring minimum levels of logging in Windows, there is also a sinkhole script that I wrote, which will pull a list of known botnet hosts, and add them to the bitbucket, effectively re-routing any traffic that might be destined to botnets instead to $NULL. <br /><br />
        Red Vs. Blue is a long-term project to integrate various Red Team and Blue Team applications onto a single, easy-to-use platform.  In some ways, Red Vs. Blue is an exercise in using PowerShell to understand .NET form functionality, using a variety of my projects (and one of my friend's projects) as a focal point to bring it all together.<br /><br />
